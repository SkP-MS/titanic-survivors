# Titanic Survival Prediction
This is a rudimentary machine learning project that predicts passenger survival on the RMS Titanic. It uses direct datasets from Kaggle and feeds the cleaned data to train an ML model to predict passenger survival, but really, it tests how accurate it can get.

## Project Overview
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Cleaned the data by handling missing values and converting categorical features.
- Trained a Logistic Regression model.
- Achieved an accuracy of ~82% on the test set.

##` How to Run
